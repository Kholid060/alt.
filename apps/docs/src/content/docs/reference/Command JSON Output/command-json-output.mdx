import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

JSON schema that defined the action and UI of the Command Bar. This can only be returned by the command with the [`script`](/extensions/command/#script-command) type.

**Signature**

```ts
interface CommandJSON {
  view?: CommandJSONView;
  action?: CommandJSONAction;
}
```

| Name | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `view` | [`CommandJSONView`](view) | The UI of the Command Bar should be displayed |
| `action` | [`CommandJSONAction`](action) | The action that the Command Bar should perform |

:::caution
When you return both `view` and `action`, the Command Bar will only perform the `action` and won't display the `view`.
