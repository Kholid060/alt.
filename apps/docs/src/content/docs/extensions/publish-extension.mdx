This section will cover how to publish extensions into the Alt. store. 

## Preparation

Before publishing the extension into the store, you need to do some preparation as:
- Ensure the extension is valid. Check it by running the `build` script.
- The extension has correct metadata like title, description, and icon in the extension manifest.
- Ensure the `author` field in the extension manifest is your Alt. account username.
- The extension source code is available in a public [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository. Ensure to include the `manifest.json` file inside the `dist` folder in the repository.

## Publishing Extension

To publish the extension, open the Dev Console page on the Alt. website, click the "+Item" button, click the extension menu, and input the extension's GitHub repository.

On the next page, you'll see the details of the extension. Review it, and if you think everything is correct, click the submit button. When the extension is submitted, we'll review the extension. You can check the extension status by going to the Dev Console page on the website.

Once accepted, the extension will be published to the store.
