Set an alias or shortcut to a command to make it faster to access it. You can do it by going to the dashboard -> extension.

## Alias

Alias can make it easier to find a command inside the Command Bar. For example, when you define `kp` as an alias for the "Kill Process" command.

You only need to type `kp` in the input view of the Command Bar, and the command will immediately show up. And press `space` or `enter` to run the command.

## Shortcut

Run a command from anywhere by pressing the shortcut you assigned to the command. This is handy if you want to run a command you often use quickly.
