Use the variables to store a value in the workflow. The variables only live while the workflow is running, and are deleted when it finishes.

This variable can be used as a node parameter value using the [expressions](/workflows/expressions).

## Initial Variable

To set the initial variable in the workflow, click the <VariableIcon className="icon" /> button on the top right and click the "+" button to add a variable.

## Variable Name

You can name the variable whatever you want. But for easier access, it's recommended to write the variable name in [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) or [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) and avoid symbols such as dot(.) or bracket([]). For example, `variableName` or `variable_name`
